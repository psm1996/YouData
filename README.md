## Problem Statement
Students taking online lectures often find it difficult to get relevant videos on the topics of their interest. 

They comment on several videos to persuade the content providers to make videos on these topics, but these comments are often not seen by the content providers.

The comments chosen are then analyzed to extract keywords out of them. These keywords are then shown to the content Provider so that the can make a note of the topics that are in demand.
