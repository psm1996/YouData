"SIR watched yr video on WHAT IS A SIGNAL As always i liked yr above video and understood which one we call a signal and which one not..To tell frankly i did not know/realise that if a current is not changing with respect to time, then it is not called a signal.Yr example of an equation explained there in clearly helps the above concept..  While Analogue signal is clear to me, i will await to understand what a DIGITAL SIGNAL is.Thanking u Vatsa"	0

"I got no experience in android development and programing so i decided to start by this very basic course? https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud837/lessons/4038208680/concepts/42913549310923# At the begining of the course it sounds like magic i could understand everything because the teacher follower trough step by step leaving no explanation behind, so she started asking to do the next task before explain as a chalenge, it was ok because i could aways step forward if locked see and study the answer, but now she is trying to make me do things that she didnt explain expecting that i already know and when i step forward theres is other new task and not the explanation anymore. i spent 2 days stuck on this one task searching everywhere on internet like a retarded just to learn how to associate 2 buttons on java and no one code i tried worked. this course is shit. if i have to look by myself for answers on internet i dont need a course i can self thought me watching youtube videos. would be the same."	0

"I'm terribly weak on the C language which this appears to be: but when you declared ""LEDPin"" as it is outside the setup function which is run once when the compiled program is run; haven't you declared a constant, and not a variable as you keep referring to ""LEDPin""? Constants are set at compile time and are immutable symbols. I'm assuming that if you made the statement ""LEDPin=13;"" inside either the setup or loop function, the IDE would give you an error?Just a possible niggle on a fantastic looking program you have created!"	0
